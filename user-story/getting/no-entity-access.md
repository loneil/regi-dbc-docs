# No User Access to the Entity, no DBC

Story: Given that I am not a system user associated with a system Account that manages the business, then the option to request a Digital Business Card is not available to me

- Shows access to DBC issuance for a valid user for an SP
- then with a different user that does not have access to the SP, can't get to the issueance
- as a Staff user who CAN get to the business, cannot get a DBC
