# User Story Demonstrations

This section holds video demonstrations of the documented user stories.

See the User Stories document for the corresponding list (final location TBD? [current here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRFV8nF-Ub30a_-6Tx5FYRPg5OL96OFjag-U7Wd4R3Q/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jwh7wtqsa4gf)). Will not reproduce content of stories here so it can be updated in one place only.

### Environment Notes

User stories will be generally be documented in the **TEST** BCROS [environment](https://test.bcregistry.gov.bc.ca) using TEST BC Service Card logins (from the https://idtest.gov.bc.ca environment). As such, some documented cases may appear slightly different thatn production cases.

Test BCSC Logins just use a username/password that corrsponds to a test-created BC Services Card account.

The [OCA Bundle](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-oca-bundles/) for test-issued credentials contains a "Non-Production" watermark. Can see below vs a real production DBC:

The Issuer Name offering and Contact Name in the BC Wallet appears as "BC Registries Test" instead of "BC Registries"
